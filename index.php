            <p>
                We present Catty, a safe haven for feline friends in need. Our mission is to rescue, care for, and rehome cats of all ages, breeds, 
                and personalities. At Catty, we believe every cat deserves a loving home where they can thrive and feel cherished. Our dedicated team of 
                volunteers works tirelessly to provide medical care, socialization, and a nurturing environment for each cat in our shelter. Whether 
                you're looking to adopt a new furry companion or support our efforts, you're helping us make a difference in the lives of cats. Join us 
                in giving these incredible animals a second chance at happiness!
